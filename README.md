The application will have a user interface where the user can input a phrase or a sentence. Upon submitting the phrase, the backend, built using the MERN stack, will process the input using natural language processing techniques.

The backend will first use libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or Gensim to preprocess the input phrase, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify relevant entities like persons, locations, and organizations.

Once the backend has the preprocessed phrase, it will use a data science algorithm to search a database of song lyrics to identify the songs where the input phrase has been used. The search algorithm could utilize techniques such as word embeddings or TF-IDF to match the input phrase with the lyrics in the database.

After identifying the relevant songs, the backend will return the song titles, artist names, and any other relevant metadata to the frontend. The frontend will display this information to the user in a visually appealing way, allowing them to explore the songs that contain the input phrase.

Overall, this MERN stack-based web application would be a useful tool for anyone interested in discovering songs that contain specific phrases or lyrics. It could be further improved by adding features like song previews, links to streaming platforms, and a user account system for saving favorite songs.
